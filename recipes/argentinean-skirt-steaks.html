    <h1>Argentinean Skirt Steaks</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is the most requested main dish in my house. Everyone loves it and that is a rare thing indeed! These steaks are almost too simple to believe and they turn out great every single time. So tender and flavorful - you just can't mess them up! The adobo seasoning is quite salty, so keep that in mind as you season the steaks.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skirt steak, trimmed and cut into 2 1/2-inch wide pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon adobo seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>        
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Season skirt steak pieces all over with adobo. </li>
        <li>Step 2: Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak in hot oil and butter, turning often, until steak begins to firm, and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>        
    </ol>
    <h1>Cook's Note:</h1>
    <p>I usually end up popping them in the microwave on a microwaveable serving platter for another minute or two to prevent over-browning, yet assuring that they are done all the way through. </p>
